## Hi, I'm Grace!  
I'm a rising junior at Bates College in Lewiston, Maine.   

### Summer 2022
I'm so excited to be the Summer 2022 Dorothy W. Sanborn Intern at the Rufus
Porter Museum of Art and Ingenuity in Bridgton, Maine! My responsibilities 
will include leading tours, organizing volunteers, and, most excitingly, using
R to create interactive digital maps for an upcoming exhibit on the travels of
Rufus Porter and other mid-19th century itinerant artists. 
      
### Course of Study  
**Major**: Digital Archives. This interdisciplinary major combines courses
      from Digital and Computational Studies (DCS) and History to explore how we
      can learn more about the lives of people in the past by using the digital 
      tools of the present.  
**Minors**: Mathematics and Russian Language.  
      
### Interests

Data visualization in R  
Creating interactive maps through Leaflet
