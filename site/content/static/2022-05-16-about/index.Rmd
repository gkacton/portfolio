## Hi, I'm Grace!  
I'm a rising junior at Bates College in Lewiston, Maine.   
      
### Course of Study  
**Major**: Digital Archives. This interdisciplinary major combines courses
      from Digital and Computational Studies (DCS) and History to explore how we
      can learn more about the lives of people in the past by using the digital 
      tools of the present.  
**Minors**: Mathematics and Russian Language.
