<h3>Current Project at the Bates Museum of Art</h3>
<p>I’m currently working on helping the Bates Museum of Art develop a crowdsourcing platform to re-tag the art in our digital collection database. When the collection database was made, there was no consistent schema in place for how to tag artworks. As a result, the database is not easily searchable or filter-able, and there are several works that have no tagging beyond the object type. There are 8,000 works in the collection, making it impossible for the small museum staff to re-tag everything themselves.We are looking to use <a href="https://www.zooniverse.org/projects">Zooniverse</a> to host a crowdsourcing project, which will let art-loving volunteers provide tags for us! I’m very excited to be working on this project, and will post updates as we move forward!</p>
